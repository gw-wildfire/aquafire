**DATA & FILE OVERVIEW**

1\. File List:

California Wildfire Perimeters (All): Data obtained through CAL FIRE Wildfire Perimeters and Prescribed Burns. The service includes layers that are data subsets symbolized by size and year of wildfire area, burn date, and size.

Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDEs): Data obtained through The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) GDE Pulse dashboard. Represents areas in California deemed most likely to be GDEs according to criteria described in Klausmeyer et al., 2018.

California Ecoregions: Data obtained through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Dataset includes name, area, longitude, and latitude of California's 13 ecoregions.

California Counties: Data obtained through California's Open Data portal. Dataset containes California country information such as name, longitute, latitude, and shape (area).

2\. There are two versions of the California Ecoregion available. For this project, we used version 3 (v.III) of California's ecoregion dataset which cointains 13 ecoregions within California. All other datasets only contain one version.
